​	AlzDB is the first multi-omics Alzheimer's Disease comprehensive database, and it has unlimited access at www.alzdb.com.

​	In order to make it easier for researchers to use AlzDB on mobile devices, we have specially developed the Android mobile version and optimized the touch screen operation of the web page and browser. AlzDB apk files can now be downloaded and used for free [here](https://github.com/huhansan666666/AlzDB/blob/master/AlzDB.apk).
